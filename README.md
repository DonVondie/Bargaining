Bargaining Problem

"When the bargainers have a common medium of exchange, the problem may take on an especially simple form. In many cases the money equivalent of a good will serve as a satisfactory approximate utility function. (By the money equivalent is meant the amount of money which is just as desirable as the good to the individual with whom we are concerned.) This occurs when the utility of an amount of money is approximately a linear function of the amount in the range of amounts concerned in the situation. When we may use a common medium of exchange fo the utility function for each individual the set of points in the graph is such that that portion of it in the first quadrant forms an isosceles right triangle. Hence the solutoin has each bargainer getting the same money profit."

John Forbes Nash, 1950, "The Bargaining Problem", Econometrica
